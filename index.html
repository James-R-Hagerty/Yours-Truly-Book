                    Someday the story of your life will be written. The only 
                    question is how well or badly it will be written—what sort 
                    of picture it will leave behind for friends and family 
                    members, including those not yet born.

                    I’ve written Yours Truly for anyone who wants that story to 
                    be fair, accurate, interesting and maybe even inspiring. My 
                    book explains how to make sure your story is told the way 
                    you want—and how thinking about and preparing your story can 
                    help you live a better life.

                <p class="book-description">
                    My advice: Tell your own story. Don’t leave it to friends or 
                    family, who almost certainly will make a hash of it.

                    Yours Truly also guides you in writing the life story of a

            <p class="praise-description">
                <strong>
                    "You might think that a book about obituaries, written by an 
                    obituary writer, is about death–but you’d be wrong. “Yours 
                    Truly” is very much about life and is a must-read for anyone 
                    who expects, eventually, to die. That’s pretty much all of 
                    us (unless you have some secret the rest of us missed.) 
                    Hagerty’s premise is that writing our own obituary not only 
                    eliminates the possibility that someone will get our story 
                    wrong, but also provides us with a guide for living here and 
                    now. The idea is: write down how you want to be remembered 
                    and then live into it. This book sparkles with compelling 
                    stories–humorous, poignant, and as engrossing and readable 
                    as a first-rate novel. Once I’d started reading “Yours 
                    Truly,” I couldn’t put it down until I’d finished the very 
                    last sentence. It really is that good."
